  Production Focus is an Alexa skill that helps generate productivity.

  To start using Production Focus, try saying "create a new task to exercise today at 7 p.m.".
  You can also create repeating reminders by saying "create a new recurring reminder to exercise daily at 7 p.m."
  Mark a task as done by saying "mark as done task exercise".
  You can view your current divergence meter, or how well you're doing on your tasks (lower is better) by saying "view divergence".
  You will receive periodic SMS reminders for tasks that you do infrequently.
